Title: Typing-Teaching Rhythm Game
Members: Caleb Long
Type: Unity C# Game
Domain: Educational game
Description: I wish to develop a game that implements rhythm-game gameplay and typing software to help one gain proficiency with their preferred keyboard layout. Notes would be cleared by typing rather than hitting a certain button, and certain gameplay elements would be heavily inspired by action/RPG games to provide the user a more engaging experience. I plan to implement speed options to alter the difficulty, custom song mapping, and combo-powerups.
