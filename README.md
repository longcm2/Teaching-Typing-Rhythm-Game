Title: Typing-Teaching Rhythm Game

Members: Caleb Long

Type: Unity C# Game

Domain: Educational game

Description: I wish to develop a game that implements rhythm-game gameplay and typing software to help one gain proficiency with their preferred keyboard layout. Notes would be cleared by typing rather than hitting a certain button, and certain gameplay elements would be heavily inspired by action/RPG games to provide the user a more engaging experience. I plan to implement speed options to alter the difficulty, custom song mapping, and combo-powerups.

Installation: Download and extract the latest release hosted here. Program is compatible with modern Windows operating systems. Others may be supported through the use of the third-party software Wine.

Features:
  1. Note processing
      Proven by the ability to load a file and have notes appear at the correct time.
  2. User input
      Proven by the ability to enter input and, upon entering the correct input, having a note being cleared.
  3. Powerups
      Proven by the ability to press the grave key (`) after the powerup meter, charged by input, is filled.
  4. Win and lose conditions
      Proven by the ability to win the game after clearing all notes or lose the game after running out of lives.
  5. Animations
      Proven by the ability to see character animation when a lyric is sung or a button is pressed.
  6. User settings
      Proven by the ability to alter the backlog maximum and life count on the title screen.
  7. User songs
      Proven by the ability to create a .lt file using the script and load it into the program.
  8. Professionalisation
      Proven by the professional look and feel to the project, significantly improved from earlier versions.
      
User Manual:
    Welcome to Tapping Typist! Type in a song to begin. Two songs are included in the release file: "enigma" and "i h8 u". Feel free to use the script hosted here to create your own file using a .svp file (Synthesizer V Project file).
    
    I recommend that you start with a high life count and backlog maximum, as this game is difficult. I also recommend that you try a test game with a keyboard layout you are proficient with before attempting to learn a new one.
    
    The powerup is usable after the meter reaches 100 -- this is reached through pressing keys during rests or typing lyrics during verses. Use the powerup by pressing the grave key, which clears the entire backlog!
    
    The game will automatically exit after you win or lose all of your lives. Good luck!
